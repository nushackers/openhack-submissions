# OpenHack 2020 Submissions

In light of the disruption of our regular events because of the COVID-19 situation, we have started OpenHack. OpenHack is a new initiative by NUS Hackers that aims to promote the spirit of hacking amongst students, encouraging students to contribute to existing open-source projects and/or create new (and fun!) open-source projects of your own. Non-NUS students are definitely welcome to participate in this challenge as well! More details can be found at [OpenHack's website](https://openhack.nushackers.org/).

## Submission Process

To perform a submission:

1. Click at the **Issues** tab at the top, and then click the **New Issue** button. Alternatively, you can click [here](https://github.com/nushackers/openhack-submissions/issues/new/choose).
2. Get started with the **Submissions** option.
3. Submit your challenge details in the issue submission form. Change the issue title to your name.
4. Note that we are using an issue template, so only edit the portions relevant to your submission. You can preview the submission form by click on the **Preview** tab.

## Quality Standards

Valid PRs must meet the following criteria:

* Has to be non-trivial (i.e. more than typo fixes or small documentation changes)
* Only pull requests made on the [list of approved repositories](https://openhack.nushackers.org/rules#repos) are counted
* Work should be self-initiated, and you cannot submit your coursework/homework (e.g. work done for Orbital, CS2103, CS3281/82 and other modules is not acceptable)

Valid self-initiated open-source projects must meet the following criteria:

* Project should be new and original, and not have come from any previous work (inspiration from previous works is okay, but plagiarism is not)
* Usage of software frameworks / libraries built by others are allowed
* For ideas on what a project should look like, you can check out [submissions for Hack&Roll 2020](https://hacknroll2020.devpost.com/submissions) (the rule of thumb is this: if your project shows some effort we will consider it as substantial)
* Project must be functional
* Creation of the project repository must be after the launch of OpenHack
* Hardware hacks â€” you can upload your schematics, CAD files and the like. A video of the working project would be great!
* Project must be self-initiated, and you cannot submit your work for other commitments (e.g. work done for Orbital, CS2103, CS3281/82 and other modules is not acceptable)
* Project must continue to stay open-source even after the event is over
